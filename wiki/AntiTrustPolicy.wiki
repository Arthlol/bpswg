#summary WfMC Anti Trust Policy

=ANTI-TRUST POLICY=
Coalition members shall observe the following regarding the joint activities of the Coalition:

1. All Specifications designated by the Coalition will relate to WfM product areas involving interoperability of products and will not involve other WfM technology areas which would be the basis of competitive differentiation.  Participation in the Coalition, and/or the design, specification or interpretation of the Specifications will not be used as a means of fixing prices, boycotting distributors or otherwise restricting competition.

2. The design of the Specifications will be based on the technical and practical merits of the various proposals and will not be designed, specified or interpreted in a manner which intentionally discriminates against anyone.

3. There will be no exchange of information among Coalition Members relating to costs, sales, profitability, prices, marketing or distribution of any individual company product or service other than the Specifications.

4. Nothing in the Document of Understanding imposes, or should be interpreted as imposing any duty or obligation on any member to adhere to the Specifications.  Each member remains free to follow or reject all or any portion of the Specifications.

5. Adequate notice of specification/development or interpretation proceedings must be given to all known affected persons and all known affected persons must be given a fair opportunity to comment on specification design and interpretations.

6. Nothing in the Document of Understanding shall be construed to limit any party's right to obtain services or software programs from other sources, to prohibit or restrict any party from independently developing or acquiring competitive materials, nor to limit any party's right to deal with any other vendors, suppliers, contractors or customers.
