#summary WfMC Anti Trust Policiy

=STATEMENT ON ANTI-TRUST POLICY=
The Workflow Management Coalition and all its committees and working groups adhere rigidly to the WfMC Anti-trust policy.  [AntiTrustPolicy This policy is attached in full] and is summarized here.

Each member of the Business Process Simulation Working Group (BPSWG) has the responsibility to avoid raising unsuitable subjects for discussion and to keep in mind that the purpose of the WfMC is to promote the use of BPM/workflow (through the establishment of standards for software terminology, interoperability and connectivity between BPM/workflow standards) and not individual company's activities in the marketing of particular products.

Accordingly, the following matters as they relate to specific member company products or plans are not to be considered or discussed:

•	product development

•	marketing

•	purchasing

•	pricing

More precisely the following may not be discussed nor information exchanged in fact or appearance:

•	Individual company current or projected pricing, discounts, etc. or data that bears on pricing.

•	Industry pricing policies, price levels, price changes, etc.

•	Changes in industry production, capacity, or inventory.

•	Plans of individual companies concerning design, characteristics, production, distribution, or introduction dates of particular products.

(Note that these same restrictions must be adhered to even at social gatherings incidental to WfMC and/or BPSWG meetings.
