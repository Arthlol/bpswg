The Coalition Members will jointly own any copyrights in the expressions of the WfMC Specifications.

Each expression of the WfM Specification must include a conspicuous copyright notice referencing each Coalition Member, or former Coalition Members, whose copyrighted material is included in such WfM Specification.
